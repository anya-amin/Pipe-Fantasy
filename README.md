# Pipe-Fantasy
Major Project of Fundamentals of Computer Science 1 using the language Racket

This project was the final major project of this class, in which I was tasked to create a pipe game. The goo would start flowing at around the time that the game started and the user would have to put the pipes down to connect the pipes and make it a path. Using Racket, a lot of abstract had to be used in order to assure that based on user input of their clicks, it would execute the right action.
