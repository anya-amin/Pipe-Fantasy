# Pipe-Fantasy
Major Project of Fundamentals of Computer Science 1 using the language Racket

I created a pipe game in Racket for my final project of the class. The goal of the game was the place and arrage the different pipes in order to create a path before the green goo went through the pipes. At the bottom, the score was kept as well as a visual of the upcoming pipes that the user can place to create the path. I added real-time mechanics so that when a player clicks to place pipes or create a continuous path, the game will react accordingly to their actions. I had to handle the game-state and abstract user input into actions using Racket's functional programming features. Through this project, I gained experience managing real-time systems, successfully abstracting user input, and applying functional programming concepts to problem-solving.
